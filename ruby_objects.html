<h1>Ruby notes: Objects</h1>
<h2>Objects etc...</h2>
<h3><strong>class keyword</h3>
'New up' a class with the <strong>class</strong> keyword.
<p>
<code>
class Song
<br/>
  def initialize(artist, title, duration)
<br/>
      @artist = artist
<br/>
      @title = title
<br/>
      @duration = duration
<br/>
  end
<br/>
end 
</p>
</code>
<h3>naming conventions</h3>
Class names start with a capital letter, methods lower case.
Ruby provides an <code>initialize</code> method, by default.  This is similar to a constructor - it will receive constructor parameters.  It can be overridden...  
<p/><strong>Instance variables</strong> are denoted by '@'
<h3>inspect and to_s (to string)</h3>
<code>Inspect</code> gives us a string representation of any object; but the output isn't nicely formatted.  Override <code>to_s</code> in the subclass providing some special formatting...
<h3>Class inheritance the &lt; notation</h3>
<ul><li>Indicate object inheritance by using the &lt; character.</li>
<li>Call the corresponding superclass bit via the <pre>super</pre> keyword</li>
<li>Use the keyword <monospace>super</monospace> to call up the object hierarchy</li>
<li>Ruby will allocate the class <pre>Object</pre> as the default supertype if a class does not explicitly declare one</li> 
</ul>  
For example, 
<code><pre>class KaraokeSong < Song
  def initialize(name, artist, duration, lyrics)
    super(name, artist, duration)
    @lyrics = lyrics
  end
end</pre></code>
<h3>Inheritance and Mixins</h3>
Ruby does not provide multiple inheritance <i>per se</i> but it does support <pre>Mixins</pre>.  Mixins allow functionality to be composed from different places, without incurring the ambiguity of multiple inheritance.
<b>A Mixin is like a partial class definition.</b>
<h3>Object attributes</h3>
We can return attribute values via accessor methods, e.g.
<code>
<pre>
class Song
  def artist
    @artist
  end
  def title
    @title
  end
  def duration
    @duration
  end
end
</pre>
</code>
But because this is such a common idiom, Ruby provides an 'accessor methods' shorthand, wich looks like,
<code>
<pre>
class Song
  attr_reader :artist, :title, :duration # this use of colon is a Symbol - the @ denoted instance variables/ attributes are created implicitly!!!!
end 
</pre></code>
<b>A Symbol - that employs the colon, e.g. ':artist' denotes the variable name, while the variable name itself, e.g. 'artist' is the pointer to the actual value.
<h3>Attribute value assignment</h3>
Ruby uses setters for class attributes - similarly to getters shown above.  It includes an idiosyncracy that if a method name includes an '=' sign in the title, it will be eligible for the left hand side of a value assignment, e.g.
<code><pre>
class Song
  def duration=(newDuration)
    @duration=newDuration
  end
end
</pre></code>
As before, Ruby provides a shorthand, "attr_writer" 
<code><pre>
class Song
  attr_writer :duration
end
aSong = Song.new("Bicylops", "Fleck", 260)
aSong.duration = 257</pre></code>
<h3>Virtual Attributes</h3>
Methods that look like setters but actually perform a calculation - and return that value (but don't hold it as a field). 
Here's a coded example - <i>note the methods have similar names - the signature that takes a parameter is called through the use of the equals sign</i> 
<code><pre>
class Song
  def durationInMinutes
    @duration/60.0   # force floating point
  end
  def durationInMinutes=(value)
    @duration = (value*60).to_i
  end
end
aSong = Song.new("Bicylops", "Fleck", 260)
aSong.durationInMinutes 	» 	4.333333333
aSong.durationInMinutes = 4.2
aSong.duration 	» 	252
</pre></code>
<h3>Class Variables</h3>
Class variables are close to the Smalltalk definition of classes.  The value held in a class variable is shared across all instances of that class - if it is set once in code, all other references to that class or object instances of that type will get access to that same shared value.  
<ul><li>They must be initialized before use</li><li>They are NOT global or instance variables - whose value can be reassigned</li></ul>
<h3>Class Methods</h3>
Class methods (similar-ish to Java static methods) are declared by including the class name and period '.' in between the method name.
For example,
<code><pre>
Class Example


  def instMeth              # instance method
  end


  def Example.classMeth     # class method
  end


end
</pre></code>
<h3>Access Control</h3>
Access control is simlar to other OO languages and includes the modifiers,
<ol><li>private</li><li>protected</li><li>public</li></ol>	
But! differs in that it is dynamic - and won't provoke compiler complaints (problems emerge at runtime).
Access modifiers can be used in two ways:
<ol><li>With no arguments: everything following the declaration will receive that same visibility</li><li>Provide declared methods as arguments to an access modifier and the methods receive that visibility.</li</ol>
A class's initialize method is automatically declared to be <code>private</code>. 
<h3>Variables</h3>
...instance variables are pointers in Ruby like other OO languages
...prevent anyone from changing a particular object by freezing it
